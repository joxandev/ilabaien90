# Profile

- Experienced, highly motivated and multi skilled football coach with a proven track record of designing and delivering outstanding training programmes for football academies and world leading player development schemes

- I have fulfilled a range of roles in the academies and football schools of some of the most successful clubs in the world, for example Atletico Madrid Foundation U16 Coach, Arsenal Soccer Schools (Mumbai) U18 Coach and Real Madrid Foundation in partnership with the Chinese Super League Club Guangzhou Evergrande, Fitness Coach U15 and U16 and Head Coach U10.

- I have developed a bespoke approach to measuring the success of the young players I coach, which includes age appropriate tactical, technical and behavioural objectives. I am proud to say my teams consistently achieve the progression targets I set. This has led to my current squads winning over 60% of all the competitions they have entered in the past season, with our lowest place being third.

- During my time at Guangzhou Evergrande Academy, three players I have worked with, (AiReXiDing, Zhang AoKai and Kaiser) have made their debuts with the Chinese National Team (U17 and U18). Zhang AoKai has also been on loan at RCD Espanyol de Barcelona in the Spanish La Liga

- While working at Arsenal Schools, I was an instrumental part of the team in charge of setting up the first Football High Performance Center in Mumbai (India).

- I am able to communicate effectively in Spanish, English and Mandarin.
